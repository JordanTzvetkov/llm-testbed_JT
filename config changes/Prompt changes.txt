Updated getting species prompt:

"The user will input a series of extracts from a PubMed publication. Identify the species that are the primary focus of the study, especially those referenced frequently in the title, abstract, or experimental design. Prioritize these species over others mentioned. Respond with only the species that the publication concerns. Provide the species names in Latin, not using the common name, and follow the format FullFirstName FullLastName (e.g. 'Homo sapiens', not 'H. Sapiens' or 'Human'). If the experiment is based on a certain cell type or tissue type, please provide the species the cells are derived from, e.g. 'Homo sapiens', not 'HEK cells'. Respond in JSON, using the following schema: {\"species\": [\"1st species name\", \"2nd species name\", \"3rd species name, etc\"]} This must be parsable, so do NOT include \\n or anything similar which will make the validation fail for the JSON schema. You must respond with NO text other than the JSON."
       


Genes Prompt:
"The user will input a series of extracts from a PubMed publication. You must consider ALL genes and proteins mentioned in the paper, including genes that may have been implied. Retain only those genes/proteins for which experimental evidence or novel information about biological processes, functions, cellular location, or interactions with other proteins is provided. If no genes are retained, analyse why this might be the case. Consider if the gene information could be implicit or if there are figure annotations that might have been overlooked and try again. Finally, match these genes to the species of the paper, purely based on the publication. You are to respond only with the genes associated with the species of the paper. Respond in JSON, using the following schema: {\\\"species\\\": [{\\\"name\\\": \\\"1st species name\\\", \\\"genes\\\": [{\\\"identifier\\\": \\\"identifier of gene 1 for 1st species (database identifier was taken from if known)\\\", \\\"name\\\": \\\"name of gene 1 for 1st species\\\", \\\"symbol\\\": \\\"symbol of gene 1 for 1st species\\\"}, {\\\"identifier\\\": \\\"identifier of gene 2 for 1st species\\\", \\\"name\\\": \\\"name of gene 2 for 1st species\\\", \\\"symbol\\\": \\\"symbol of gene 2 for 1st species\\\"}, \\\"etc\\\"]}]}, etc. This must be parsable, so do NOT include \\\\n or anything similar which will make the validation fail for the JSON schema. You must respond with NO text other than the raw JSON, in compressed format (i.e. no indentation, new lines) to limit the amount of characters that must be stored. Each species object should contain ALL the genes associated with it in the paper. If some of the genes/proteins have not been assigned to a species directly, please also include them in your answer under a species name set to ‘unknown species’. For the identifier, provide e.g. UniProt, Ensembl, RefSeq, VEuPathDB or other reference IDs if given. If not, mark as "no database identifier". For gene name please provde the full naqme of the gene or leave as 'not specified' if it has not been provided, for example 'NADP/NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase PuuC' is the name for the gene 'puuC', and 'puuC' would be annotated as the gene symbol. Here are the species: "
